# Hi there, Mate ðŸ‘‹

I hope you enjoy some special coding challanges and yes I'm not talking about Competitive Programming here! I'm talking more on the visual side of things . 

This repository includes my solution to a bunch of [Dev Challanges](https://devchallenges.io/) particularly built with React. 

> All the challanges are  built with React but can also be built with vanilla JS and CSS. 

I love building UI for applications as it provides a way for me to communicate without using words. I'm all in for an Optimized, Fast and Robust User Experience that delivers the message and brings a smile on people's faces.



Currently the challanges solved by me are:
